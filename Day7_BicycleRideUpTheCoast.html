    It was forecast to be another rainy day, but I decided to make the most of it and go for a bike ride around the coast, past Ipanema and Leblon and onto Praia de Sao Conrado and 
    Praia de Barra Tijuca. You can very easily hire a bike in the city from a company called Bike Itaú. It was something like 15BRL for 5 days, and then you can just hire them 
    whenever you like and return them at any location. 
</p> 

<p>
I left at about 8am. The beaches are usually pretty vacant around these times even when the weather is good. Today they were almost entirely empty. It started to sprinkle by the
 time I got  toLeblon, but to be honest I was thankful for the rain as I am not an active bike rider and I was already sweating like a pig. There is something about bike riding 
 that I hate-- all the pain of exercise seems entirely localised in one muscle in your legs, particularly when you are trying to get up a hill, and there are a lot of hills along 
 the coast of Rio. Most of the time I got off the bike and walked up these, but it was okay as I was in no rush. Even when it is raining the coastline is very beautiful here, and 
 there are good bike lanes that allow you to travel to pretty much any area you want to go.

<p> 
From here I walked to another Rio tourist staple: Escadaria Selarón, the beautiful tiled stairs located in the Lapa neighbourhood. If there is one distinctive quality about Lapa, 
as well as the Centro district, it is the extraordinary street art. Chilean street artist Jorge  Selarón began decorating the steps in 1990, selling his own art in order to fund 
the thousands upon thousands of tiles needed for the project. He regarded the work as never-complete. As the artwork continued to grow, tiles were sourced from visitors from all
over the world. There are tiles depicting album covers, and the Simpsons and the Powerfuff girls. I didn't have my hopes up for the Selaron steps, as the images I saw in the 
travel guides didn't seem particularly interesting, and in all honesty, if you only have a few days in Rio it is probably skippable. But if you are in the area or if it is on 
the way then it is definitely worthwhile for a visit. Of course, the steps would have been far more beautiful if they were not completely obscured by the hordes of tourists that 
flock there every day.

<p> 
After the steps, I went for a walk around the Lapa district. While Lapa may have been a trendy spot in the past, my impression of it today was that it was a shell of its former self. 
Every second shop was closed, shuttered, and covered in graffiti. The once beautiful buildings were in ruin. There were many homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk and the 
entire vibe of the place was seedy.

<p> 
If the district is a dilapidated relic, then it is fitting that it is also home to dozens of antique shops, which were just about the only shops open when I was walking 
around the area in the morning.   To the north there is also one of the most oppressive, and bizarre cathedrals I have ever seen: Catedral de São Sebastião. Apparently 
the architect was inspired by Mayan temples, but the end product looks more like what would happen if the director of Bladerunner decided to build a nuclear water cooling
tower.

<p> 
The only redeeming quality I found about Lapa was the street art which was in some pretty surprising places. You walk down a random backroad where 12 year old kids are smoking reefers,
and there, on a random wall of a burnt out building, is a colourful mural of a chicken: just one of the many hidden gems waiting to be discovered.

<p> 
    I kept heading north, past the cathedral and finally made it to the Centro district. After my time in Lapa, I was starting to regret coming to this area of town, 
    but Rio is always full of surprises. You walk a few more blocks and suddenly it feels like you are in another city. The roads widened and became cleaner, the shops opened, 
    skyscrapers started popping up, and I found myself in the main financial hub of the city. I had heard about a famous café in the area called Confeiteiras Colombo, so I decided 
    to pay it a visit. It was jam packed with people, and after spending some time there I could understand why. The two storey café dates back to 1894, and the interior is decked 
    out with elaborate mirrors on  every wall and beautiful historic lighting.

<p> 
    The food and drinks were also top notch. They sold a large variety of savoury and sweet pastries. 
    I had a pistachio eclair with an espresso coffee, both excellent, as well as a prawn and cheese breaded croquette, which was nice without being spectacular. 
    I tried to also order a caipirissima and a strawberry tart, but my accent must have been terrible because the waitress brought out a strawberry caipirissima: a happy little 
    accident. The whole meal including drinks cost about 100BRL or 25 Australian dollars.

<p> 
    After lunch, I kept walking north towards the water, and stopped off at the Museu do Amanhã (The Museum of tomorrow). I was attracted to it because of the very striking building 
    which juts out into the water, but the museum was not really my style. It was the kind of place where they put a lot of money into fancy looking exhibitions, with a lot of 
    interactive screens and displays, which is great for Instagram opportunities, but you come away from it without learning a damn thing. So I left pretty quickly and kept heading 
    along the waterline towards the aquarium. Along the way there was some interesting murals, painted on the sides of the docks.

<p> 
    Now, I've seen a few aquariums before and a lot of the them are pretty similar. The entrance ticket was also about $40 australian dollars, which is fairly exe by Rio standards. 
    But it turned out to be a very good aquarium. There were many large tanks with a variety of species inside. The highlights included a giant eel, a tank of piranhas, which we got
     to see during feeding time (they really do go apeshit), and a collection of corals which, when displayed under ultraviolet light, glowed to reveal their hidden colors. 
     There was also a tunnel going through the largest tank, so you could see the sharks passing over you.

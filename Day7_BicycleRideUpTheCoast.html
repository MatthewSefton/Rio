    It was forecast to be another rainy day, but I decided to make the most of it and go for a bike ride around the coast, past Ipanema and Leblon and onto Praia de Sao Conrado and 
    Praia de Barra Tijuca. You can very easily hire a bike in the city from a company called Bike Itaú. It was something like 15BRL for 5 days, and then you can just hire them 
    whenever you like and return them at any location. 
</p> 

<p>
I left at about 8am. The beaches are usually pretty vacant around these times even when the weather is good. Today they were almost entirely empty. It started to sprinkle by the
 time I got  toLeblon, but to be honest I was thankful for the rain as I am not an active bike rider and I was already sweating like a pig. There is something about bike riding 
 that I hate-- all the pain of exercise seems entirely localised in one muscle in your legs, particularly when you are trying to get up a hill, and there are a lot of hills along 
 the coast of Rio. Most of the time I got off the bike and walked up these, but it was okay as I was in no rush. Even when it is raining the coastline is very beautiful here, and 
 there are good bike lanes that allow you to travel to pretty much any area you want to go.

    I found myself at what I thought was Tijuca beach, and I found a station to return my bike, but however hard I tried I could not lock the bike into the station. I looked around for someone to help but there was nobody there. I didn't want to be held responsible for losing the bike and paying some ridiculous fee, so I left the beach and tried to find another station. After cycling up a few roads, I found myself in front of a favela. I realised that I had miscalculated how far I had come, and I was not in Tijuca at all, but rather at Praia de Sao Conrado. And the favela was actually Rocinha! It was interesting seeing the very bottom of Rocinha, where the favela meets the city. Like Edwin said, there were a lot of people in business clothes heading to work. 
</p> 

<p>
    Now, it probably would have been completely fine for me to return my bike there, but all those stories of the favela and the warnings to tourists must have gotten to me, because I chickened out like the little bitch that I am. I cycled back the way I came, but then once again got lost-- my sense of direction is not great in cities-- and ended up this time on a freeway! This was not ideal, but one thing that I did discover was the golf course right outside of Rocinha-- a beautiful green paradise surrounded by mountains on 3 sides and the beach on the other. It was stunning contrast between poverty and luxury. 
</p> 

<p>
    After this, I was thinking of heading back to my hotel, but after stopping for a beer at the beach, I mustered up some more strength and courage and decided I would once again hire a bike and make my way to Tijuca. Along the way, I went past Pedra da Gavea. Looking at the mighty rock, which today was partially concealed in cloud, I decided that I would commit to climbing it and booked a guide for the following Monday.

    Following the coast for another half an hour, I made it to Tijuca beach, which is a beautiful beach in its own right and far longer than Copacabana or Ipanema, but after cycling along it for another half an hour or so I decided it was pretty much all of the same: hotels, coco verde stands, and even in the foul weather, the locals had come out to play volleyball and raquet ball.

<p>
    Tired from my ride, I caught a taxi back to Copacabana. For a late lunch, I stopped off at a famous sandwich joint called Cervantez, and ordered the ham sandwich with pineapple and cheese. This was very tasty, and the bread in particular was good, but the sandwich was a little dry and perhaps not as nice as the one I had yesterday. By that time It was starting to pour, so I decided to end the day here and went back to the hotel.

    Woke up early, still jet lagged, to see the sunrise over the beach from my hotel window. 
    <p>

    I had breakfast at the hotel: mostly fruit and pastries, then headed out to the Cristo Redentor.  Now, there a few ways you can get to the famous statue. You can walk up through Tijuca forest or you can catch a van up there, but I chose the traditional way: catching the cog train up to the top.
</p>

<p>
I caught the subway to Largo de Manchado then walked the rest of the way to the cog train.  
There is a sense in which the people of Rio are both relaxed and alert. As women pass me in the subway, I see that some of them are wearing their backpacks in reverse, presumably to prevent theft. The men do not do this, I have noticed, but on the train they keep their possessions close to them, on their laps.
The line to see Christ was long and I was already sweating like a pig in the sun by the time I made it to the cog train.

    There is a story about Jesus. One day he travelled to Jerusalem and saw merchants there selling sheep and cattle and doves. Making a chord out of rope, he began to whip the 
    merchants. As they ran away he shouted after them (and here I am paraphrasing), "Are you kidding me with this shit? Get the fuck out of my dad's house you greedy whores! 
    Fuck!" In keeping with this spirit, the path up to the statue of Christ is lined with merchant selling Tikki-Takki: stuffed Toucan's, pillows with I heart Rio on them, 
    fluro pink Christ the Redeemer statues and so on. 

</p>


<p> 
    The train ride up to the Christ is not the easiest way to get there, but it is traditional and offers some nice views of the Tijuca forest-- a dense jungle filled with monkeys and 
    jackfruit trees-- and some panoramas of Rio-- not nearly as nice as the ones at the top, but it's a good build up. 
</p>

<p>The top is packed with tourists and, in their defence, the view IS spectacular. What is striking about Rio is the dynamic landscape: the dramatic peninsulas and beaches, the 
    contrast between high spaces and low. Humans, as always, are drawn to the extremes, and Rio is a place of extremities.
</p>

<p> The area is also home to a number of resident monkeys that seem pretty well-adjusted to the thousands of tourists that pass by every day. There were also some 
    transcendental yellow butterflies floating around people's heads. Occasionally one would drift past your face, or alight on a nearby person's cap -- perhaps 
    mistaking it for the bud of some enormous flower.

<p>Oh yeah, there was also a statue up there too-- and as far as statues go this was a rather good one. The original design, conceived in 1921, was going to have
     Jesus holding a cross in his right hand and a globe in his left. After facing criticism from the National school of fine arts, the design was changed so that it 
     could be seen from afar. The final design is credited to a French sculptor Paul Landowski in 1924. With it's minimalist, bold design-- it is very much in keeping 
     with the art deco style of the period. But despite the minimalism and strong lines of the piece, the face of Jeshua is soft, complex and empathetic. As the masses 
     of tourists take selfies with their vintage Instagram filters, and their arms outstretched,  the statue looks down on them with a sad, knowing expression, as if 
     to say 'this too can be redeemed.'

    I was tired and sunburnt so I caught a taxi back to the hotel, had a quick lunch, then headed off for sugarloaf mountain. To get there, you have to take the cable car 
    and it cost me about $50 AUD as well as an hour waiting in line. I didn't know exactly what to expect from sugarloaf and suspected it was just a viewing platform for
     more panoramas of Rio. But the place hits hard. I mean it really is beautiful. The best views, I have learnt, are not always at the highest vantage point. When you are 
     looking down from Cristo Redentor, the mountains do not seem so significant-- the difference between their sizes is diminished-- but from the middle way vantage point 
     everything is made more dramatic. 
  </p>

<p>
    And sugarloaf also has bars and food-- I got caipirinha and an ice-cream and sat down on a bench overlooking the ocean. There was a band playing live music, people were dancing.
    An old lady came and sat next to me. 'Nice view' I said, 'eh nice view,' she replied. She then saw that I had my backpack at my feet, and she went 'tch tch tch' and waved her 
    finger at me, then picked up my bag and put it on my lap. "Tourista!" I exclaimed, feeling slightly buzzed after my drink. She just shook her head at me. I had another beer 
    and then for some inexplicable reason began to feel sad: the sudden highs and lows of travelling alone.     
</p>

  <p>
    Now, there is actually a second cable car that takes you up to the highest point of sugarloaf, but I got up to the first point too late and missed the opportunity to get up to 
    the second one. Still, I wasn’t upset as the place was beautiful. I stayed until  sunset, as is tradition, and watched as the people cheered on the arrival of night.

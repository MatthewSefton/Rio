    Was going to go to Ilha grande today but there were no longer spaces available on the tour. A shame, because I had heard it was beautiful. In lieu of this, I decided to do an a cooking course. 
    The place where the course was run was inside a tiny shop, upstairs inside a shopping mall in Ipanema. Most of the shops inside the mall were closed down, and when I got to the cooking school, 5 minutes before the course was supposed to start, the lights were off and no-one was home. Finally a girl arrived and awkwardly waved me inside. She explained to me that she didn’t speak English. This surprised me because the course was advertised as being in English. I was starting to wonder if I was the only person booked, when a mother and her two children came through the door and started speaking to my host in Spanish. So then I was wondering if I had accidentally booked a Spanish course. But a few minutes later the chef arrived, apologised for being late, and explained that her assistant was still learning English.
</p> 

<p>
    I began talking to the mother, who I found out was from LA, and another girl arrived from Miami who introduced herself as Anna. Our chef Erica, began the course with an 
    explanation of the types of liquor in Brazil and a demonstration on how to make caipirinhas. We began with a simple lime caipirinhas and then tried a passion fruit version. Brazilians tend to favour the large yellow  passion fruits which are a little more sour than the purple kind we mostly get back home. A caipirinha is basically just crushed fruit, cashasa, sugar and ice. Though lime is traditional, the Brazilians use basically any kinds of fruit: strawberry, kiwi, banana, grape, lychee etc. We also tried a shot of a banana liqueur, which reminded me of the cough syrup I used to get as a child.

    The variety of cheeses here is also very good, and they used 3 kinds for this dish. The dough was rolled into little balls and cooked in an air fryer. 
    The cheese bread was served with different sauces and toppings: a delicious guava jam, Brazilian cream cheese (which tasted a bit like runny Brie) and a chilly sauce. 
    </p>

<p>
    Next, Erica made a dish which the Brazilians simply call tapioca. It is a pancake made from, you guessed it, tapioca flour that is then filled with different ingredients, either savoury or sweet. Tapioca flour looks like tiny balls of styrofoam. The amazing thing about this dish, is that it requires no oil or water. Erica simply put the tapioca into a hot pan and cooked it. After a time the beads of tapioca begin to bind together. Toppings are placed on top (in this case cheese and tomato) and the pancake is folded over. The end result is nothing special: the pancake itself is fairly flavourless and a little dry. It didn’t have the gooey quality of the pao de quejo. But it is a quick and cheap dish that is often sold here as street food, and because oil or butter is not required, it is presumably very healthy.

<p>
    At this point we got to try a very simple dish. Boiled Cassava with butter. Cassava is used to make Tapioca and all the other traditional flours the Brazilians use, but I has never tried it in its unprocessed form. It was kind of like boiled potato but softer and gooier and very delicious. 
</p>

    We then made the main course: picanha steak with rice, Farofa and a kind of salsa called that was similar to a bruschetta mix except with green capsicums. Now, picanha steak is made from the rump of a moo moo cow, and it is usually very simply cooked. The meat, served medium rare. is elevated by the two sides. Farofa, I discovered, was the name of the dry crumb-like side dish that I had encountered a couple times before. It is once again a kind of flour made from cassava, but is drier and nowhere near as sticky. This was fried up in a lot of bacon fat, onions and salt and cooked until crunchy.

    Finally, for desert, a dish called Brigadiers, which are simple chocolate truffles made from cocoa sugar and butter, rolled into balls and covered with sprinkles. A nice treat, but nothing to write home to nan about.

    We sat down to eat the lunch we had prepared and Erica and her assistant ate with us in the tiny studio. Erica and I spent a good amount of time taking about Australia. She had travelled there for a year and a half when she was 21 and looked back at it fondly as one of the best years of her life. She said she loved Ularu and getting out into nature. She also recommended I visit a beautiful place in Australia where there is nothing but ocean and sand, but she couldn’t remember the name. After some googling we realised she was taking about the Whitsundays. 
She said the hard part about being in Australia was the money, because the government do not offer much assistance. She worked in hostels to get by, but at the time she didn’t know any English. After several more caipirinhas and some good conversation with my host and the other guests, I stumbled back home to my hotel.

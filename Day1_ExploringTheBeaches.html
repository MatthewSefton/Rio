  <h1>Day 1: Exploring the Beaches</h1>
  <p>I arrived in Rio at 8am on a Sunday. There were heavily armed police and military around the entrance because the G 20 summit happened to be on. I caught an official taxi from the airport to my hotel. This was a little more expensive than an Uber 
(around $40 Aud or 190 reals) but it was quick and easy and my driver, a man named Rodrigo Lambartini,  couldn't have been more welcoming. He spoke very good English and he told me about some interesting places to go, and what to avoid. I asked him whether 
he thought the G 20 summit was going to be a problem, but he said no. While some of the shops may be closed for the next few days, the extra security around the beaches and the main areas would mean they would be safer for tourists. <p> 

<p> My first impression of Rio was of a post-apocalyptic wasteland: The favelas tumble down from the mountains and sprawl out across the industrial, decaying cityscape. There are houses with only one wall, covered in graffiti. Enormous black birds circle through 
the air like vultures. These, I later found out, were frigate birds, great sea-birds with arched wings spanning up to 2.4m across. But the area around the international airport, which I believe was probably Maré, is quite a poor one.</p>

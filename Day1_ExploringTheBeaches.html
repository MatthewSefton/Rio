  <p>I arrived in Rio at 8am on a Sunday. There were heavily armed police and military around the entrance because the G 20 summit happened to be on. I caught an official taxi from the airport to my hotel. This was a little more expensive than an Uber 
(around $40 Aud or 190 reals) but it was quick and easy and my driver, a man named Rodrigo Lambartini,  couldn't have been more welcoming. He spoke very good English and he told me about some interesting places to go, and what to avoid. I asked him whether 
he thought the G 20 summit was going to be a problem, but he said no. While some of the shops may be closed for the next few days, the extra security around the beaches and the main areas would mean they would be safer for tourists. <p> 

<p> My first impression of Rio was of a post-apocalyptic wasteland: The favelas tumble down from the mountains and sprawl out across the industrial, decaying cityscape. There are houses with only one wall, covered in graffiti. Enormous black birds circle through 
the air like vultures. These, I later found out, were frigate birds, great sea-birds with arched wings spanning up to 2.4m across. But the area around the international airport, which I believe was probably Maré, is quite a poor one.</p>

<p>The second impression I got of Rio is that it is rich and beautiful. There are many tunnels that pass through the mountains of Rio and after passing through a large one we enter into the south side of the city. The difference here could not be more striking. 
  Hundreds of hotels and apartments line the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, and behind them, beautiful green mountains. Joggers make their early morning route around the lagoon. </p>

<p>We get to the hotel. Copacabana, while a touristy area, is not quite as rich as Ipanema or Leblon. The hotel is nothing special, but it's a block back from the beach and surrounded by some good cafes and bars. I can't check in just yet, not til 2pm, 
  so I change into some looser clothes, leave my bags with the hotel and go for a walk. I have not planned out anything. It's nice when you first get to a place to just go for an explore and let your feet guide you.
Naturally I head to the beach. The beach is enormous. It is wide and maybe 5 kilometres long and there are thousands of people there, sitting on the colourful deckchairs underneath the umbrellas, or getting coco verde from one of the many many bars and stands. 
  There are vendors sitting down on carpets selling TikiTaki. I buy a cap and a pair of RayBand sunglasses  (they're genuine I swear!) The wares are surprisingly good quality: this isn't the same mass produced crap like you get in a lot of tourist countries.
  You can see people hand-making jewellery and doing macrame. 
</p>

<p>I keep walking and eventually reach the end of the beach, only to discover that this is only the end of Praia de Copacabana. As you round the peninsula you come to Praia de Ipanema (that damn song was stuck in my head for hours) and Praia de Leblon, 
  though really these are just one beach. It's much of the same: deck chairs, merchants, Coco Verde. I get a cervaja and head to an interesting looking rock that is at the end of the peninsula. This, I later found out, was called Pedra do Arpador. 
  There are steps carved into the rock and some pathways winding through the forest of prickly pears. The cacti were in bloom and hundreds of bees were nestled in the bright flowers. Little yellow birds were also chirping and hopping between the branches of 
  the salt-weathered trees. Though there were many tourists, it seems as if the majority of them spoke Portuguese (or was it Spanish? I’m not good enough to tell the difference). And there were locals as well, who had come out to enjoy the sun on their holiday. 
  At the top of the rock was a little encampment that smelt like piss and it was clear that homeless people came here to sleep some nights, though there were none there today. I had been warned about not using my phone too much in public, but others clearly had 
  not taken this advice too seriously. Almost everyone, including the locals, had their phones out and were taking selfies. 
  </p>

<p>I kept making my way along the beach, but it was getting hot and a bit repetitive so I stopped off at one of the stands and bought a coconut. A kid came up to me and tried to sell me a sob story in his broken English. I couldn't understand most of it.
  He must have been about 10 and he showed me a tattoo that I can only assume was a gang symbol? In any event, he was selling Mentos. I bought a packet, because the kid seemed nice and at least he was trying. The packet of Mentos was 8 real, 
  I gave him 10 and told him to keep the change. 
</p>

  <p>
I walked back to Copacabana through the shops, either 1 or 2 streets back from the beach. A lot of them were closed today because of G 20 summit, but there were some cool indie designer clothes here that I wouldn't mind checking out later. 
    I stopped by a market set up in one of the parks. I think this might have been the hippy markets. There were colorful clothes and a guy handmaking traditional wooden instruments. I would have bought one but I wasn't sure whether I could take them 
    through customs. 
  </p>

<p>
  When I got back to Copacabana, I still had a bit of time to kill before I could check in to my hotel at 2pm, so I went to a nearby bar called Combinado Carioca. There were a lot of people there, which was always a good sign, and there was some cool 
  music playing: some Bossa Nova or one of its many sub-genres.
</p>

  <p>
    I haven't quite mastered the art of not caring about eating at a restaurant alone, but I suppose I will have to. In any case, the food was delicious. I ordered a craft beer and the chicken thigh. The waiter also brought out these strange looking tarts 
    and offered me one. I wasn't sure if I had to pay for them or not, but I acquiesced. These were not really to my taste. The pastry was really well made, but the tarts had a very strong dried fish taste. The chicken, however, was delicious: perfectly cooked 
    and crunchy, with a tangy salsa, and a jar of complimentary pickled chili sauce called 'Pimenta.' The whole meal, including drinks was 88 BRL, or about 23 Australian bucks, which was very good value, as you would probably pay $40 or $50 for a meal of 
    similar quality in Australia.

  I went back to my hotel to discover that I was very burnt: I did not have sunscreen on because it was in my luggage. Not a great way to start the holiday, but a good day. It was only about 2:30, but I was tired and jet lagged from the trip and wanted 
  nothing more than to go to bed. Unfortunately, the hotel didn't have any bottles of water, so I walked down to the supermarket and bought some, as well as some beers, then returned to my hotel and went to sleep

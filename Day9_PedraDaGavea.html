<p>
    I woke up early, around 6am to get to Pedra da Gavea by 7:30. Initially I was worried they wouldn’t take me there this early in the morning but eventually I got an Uber X for about double the price. Still not too expensive by Australian standards. 
</p> 


<p>
    There was a little hole-in-the-wall café at the start of the walk, and I got a coffee in a plastic cup and a cheese and ham toasty. Again, very good quality cheese and bread. No-one around me was speaking English, and I was a little worried, but by this point in the trip I had learnt to relax. These things tend to sort themselves out. Some more people arrived looking pale and awkward and I recognised them immediately as other tourists. Our guide, Rodrigo, finally appeared and we set off into the national park. There were about 12 of us: all straight couples except for me and one gay divorced dentist. 
</p> 


<p>
    The trail was steep to begin with, and I very quickly started to get worried. My legs were burning and I was struggling for breath, while the other people in the group seemed unfazed. We stopped for a moment to watch some monkeys eating jackfruits but then quickly set off again at a blinding pace. Our guide lead the 7 hour hike every day, and he was born and raised in a favela so he was used to hills. I don’t think he ever sweated, or got short of breath and I don’t think I ever saw him drink water. After 20 minutes in I was starting to lag behind.  And we still hadn’t stopped for a water break. After 40 minutes in, I was feeling faint, my shirt was dripping with sweat and I was struggling to move my legs. I don’t know what it is about me and hills. I’ve done a fair bit of hiking but walking up hills always seems to destroy me. In any case I called for a rest. ‘You don’t have any hiking in Australia?’ Asked Rodrigo (I very quickly realise that Rodrigo was a shit stirrer). ‘Not as many mountains.’ I replied. In all honesty I was considering turning back home. If I was this bad after 40 minutes how the hell was I supposed to last 7 hours? I apologised. I told the group I didn’t want to hold them back. Rodrigo said I shouldn’t apologise.  ‘Climbing mountains is not like football where you have winners and losers.’ He said ‘Here everyone wins… or loses.’ I’m not sure if this was intended to reassure me, but in any case as soon as I had caught my breath we set off again. I was still worried. The further we went, the longer it would take me to get back in the event that I couldn’t continue. ‘Matthew, how you doin?’ Rodrigo would call over his shoulder every now and then, to which I would reply ‘uhh okay,’ or if I couldn’t manage that, a thumbs up.‘Is anyone here from Australia?’ He asked cheerfully, knowing full well I was the only one from Australia. ‘Goood’ he said, ‘you’re representing you’re country. Come on Matthew yeeaaah.’ 
</p> 


<p>
    Fucking favela boys with their favela thighs. Bet he wouldn’t be laughing if he was born in the flat suburbs of Newcastle. HE KNOWS NOTHING OF MY PAIN.

</p> 

<p>
    Finally after an hour we stopped for our first big water break. I was dead. I lay down in the leaf litter and let the water run down my throat and over my face. While we were resting we also encountered a strange little aardvark looking animal, which I think is called a coati (could be wrong on this). It was very friendly and was going right up to the hikers. One of the guys in the group went to feed the creature some banana but Rodrigo shouted at him. Feeding animals here is apparently very illegal.

<p>
    Rodrigo told us to put on some more sunscreen as we were about to get to the hard part. He pointed up past the trees and there was Pedra de Gavea, the great rock, looming above us, promising pain. ‘Oh good,’ I said, ‘I was starting to wonder when this was going to get challenging.’Now, at this point I realised I had left my sunscreen back at the hotel, so I borrowed some from the gay divorced dentist. What I did not realise however was that the sunscreen was 10 times thicker than the stuff I had back at home, and the lid was not on properly so it spilt all down my arm. I spread it around and realised it was not seeping in so I transferred some to my other arm. ‘Gosh this stuff is thick’ I said. ‘Yeaaah,’ said the dentist who just looked back at me with his eyebrows raised in pity.  I kept moving the sunscreen around, to my legs to my face, trying to spread it out. By this point our entire hiking group was laughing at me. Not only that, but the next hiking group had caught up to us and were laughing at me too. I had painted my entire body and face white. At that point, there was really no other option. Exhausted, dehydrated and having already embarrassed myself to the fullest possible extent, I made the only rational decision available to me: I swallowed my pride and did a tribal warrior Haka dance. 
</p> 


<p>
    My strategy in life is that one day I will become so uncool that it will circle back around and I will become cool again. So far this has not paid off. ‘You are amazing,’ Rodrigo said, beaming. I suspect this was not necessarily a compliment. ‘Come on sunscreen man, we have to get going.’
</p> 


<p>
    At this point, just when things were looking bleak, something surprising happened: the hike actually got easier. Even though we had got to the more technically difficult part of the walk, we had to take frequent breaks to rope people up and wait for them to climb  certain sections, which meant I had plenty of time to stop and catch my breath. We had also cleared much of the thick jungle below, meaning the views were now unadulterated and spectacular. We could see all the way up Tijuca beach, where I had cycled 2 days before. 
</p>

    <p>
        We came to the hardest section: a steep rock wall, at about a 70 degree angle, that we had to climb. Surprisingly I got up there relatively easily and quickly and even the other group members seemed surprised by my second wind. ‘Sunscreen man! Where is all the energy coming from?’ Rodrigo asked. ‘I just had to get my mountain legs in, I told him, smugly.

<p>
    Then, just as I was starting to build my confidence, a little girl came skipping along the trail with her father. I kid you not, this girl was eight years old, and the two of them had come out on a little daddy day trip. Not only had she hiked the trail that had just destroyed me, but the two of them went straight up to the wall and began climbing it without a rope or harness. An eighty foot wall. Her dad helped her up a couple of times, but the two still managed to get up there in half my time, smiling the whole way. 
It was at this point I realised two things:
</p> 

<p>
1. The children of the West live sheltered lives.
</p> 

<p>
2. I am very unfit.
</p>

<p>
After the wall, there was only another short hike to the top, and we were rewarded with possibly the greatest view of my life. I had already seen some spectacular views in Rio, but  I think this was my favourite. And in any case, it’s always better to earn a good view. 
</p>

<p>
    There were quite a few people milling about at the top. The girl and her father was there, and I gave the girl some of my Pringles. Some of the other hiking groups were up there resting. And many of the boys, finding any excuse to show off their abs, took off their shirt and bathed in the sun. We also had to take the ‘Tourist photo.’ This was the one that all the guided tours took. You sat down or stood at this one ledge and the guide went to another ledge a little lower down and took a shot of you with Rio in the background. As close as I got to the edge, our guide was standing up with one foot basically dangling on the edge itself, all while taking the photo. And it was a long way down.

<p>
The rock was at cloud height, and every now and then cobwebs of clouds would come rolling up from the basin and pass over us in a mist. There were also paragliders out, sailing around the mountains and riding the currents in the breeze.

<p>
    One of the guys in our group— a dude from the UK— even proposed to his girlfriend. He brought a ring up and everything. The girl said yes and everyone clapped. 
</p> 

<p>
    After half an hour we set back home. Going down was easier. The only hard part was the big wall, which some of the group who had never abseiled before found particularly challenging. But going down mountains is my specialty. I could go down mountains any day.

<p>
    On the trail on the way back, I even had enough breath to talk to Rodrigo. I asked him about Rio and about the favela where he was from. Though his English wasn’t perfect and his accent was very strong I learnt a few things. Firstly, he thought that Rocinha (the favela I had visited) was a terrible place and had become completely gentrified. He believed it was expensive there, and that basically any other favela was better. I also asked him if he thought it was safe for tourists to visit the other favelas. ‘Safe? Of course,’ he replied ‘we sell coke to the gringos all the time.’

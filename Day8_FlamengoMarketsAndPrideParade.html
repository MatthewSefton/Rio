    I woke up to a beautiful sunny morning. After café de manha (breakfast) I decided to head to Praca Sao Salvador. I had read that every Sunday they have a free choro concert there in the markets. I caught the train to Flamengo and walked the rest of the way, but I got there a little early, around 10am, and they were still setting up. So I decided to go for a stroll. After consulting google maps I saw that there was a nearby park called Parque Eduardo Guinle. It turned out that this was a very nice little discovery. It was a lovely tropical park with a lake and many birds. There were a lot of families picnicking and old ladies sitting on park benches and in general it seemed a lot safer than some of the other parks I had seen in the city.

    Around 11 o'clock I headed back to the markets, which were now in full swing. The choro band-- all 20 or so members-- were beginning to set up and many of the locals had gathered around to watch. I bought a mojito and sat down on a stone bench when a lady came up to me and handed me a pamphlet. I told her I didn't speak portuguese. 'Espanol?' she replied. 'Nao,' I said, 'Inglese.' She then asked me in perfect English where I was from and I told her Australia. She explained that there was a cultural event happening in Lapa tomorrow, that was in part a leftwing protest against the charges made against a politician called Glauber Braga. From what I gathered, this politician was speaking up for the workers, and was being censored. She said that if I was interested I should come along, and that there would be music and that it would be a good idea to see the left wing voice of Rio. I told her that I would consider it, but that I was also climbing Pedra de Gavea that day and that I might not have time for it. The woman, who might have been in her forties, introduced herself as Val and then asked me about Australia. She had heard that we were passing a bill to ban social media, and that she was very surprised by this. I told her that I didn't know too much about it, but that I had read from some people on forums that they were very pissed off about it. I also told her that I used to be a teacher, and that there was a real need to regulate social media, because of how it was affecting the kids and politics in general, but that prohibiting young people from using it was probably not the right way to go about it. She agreed with me and said that Brazil might need something similar, 'because of, you know, Elon Musk.' I had heard that just the other day, at the G20 summit, the Brazilian first lady had told Musk to fuck off, so the name was probably on everyone's lips. Val asked me some more questions about what I had done in Rio so far and how I was enjoying it and we sat and talked for another 20 minutes or so. Nice lady.

    The  choro band were playing by now. It's cool to see that jazz is still very much alive and well in a lot of Brazilian music. While it is not directly jazz,  choro seems to have emerged from Bossa nova, which has a lot of jazz influence. While it was mostly older folks at the markets there were quite a few young adults sitting around smoking beers and drinking marijuana cigarettes, or whatever it is that young people do nowadays.

    I listened for about an hour. During this time I also got up to try one of the cheese pastries from one of the street food vendors. Afterwards, I rented a bike and cycled back to Copacabana. It was easier to get back there than I thought as there were bicycle lanes through the tunnels.

    Now, I had been in Rio for 7 days, and I still hadn't been to the beach. I had walked along a lot of beach, but never lay down on a towel or went in the water. This was mostly because I was travelling alone, and I had been told not to leave my items unattended on the beach. So I was a little wary but I figured I ought to give it a go. I left my wallet and phone behind at the hotel and just took my room card and some cash. The beach of Copacabana is not exactly my idea of a relaxing way to spend a holiday. It is filed with both locals and tourists. There are people walking around shouting 'Caipirinha!' and others selling hats and trying to take photos. For some reason, boiled corn seems to be a beachside snack over here, and there were quite a few people with pots of corn. There was rubbish on the beach and pigeons pecking at the rubbish. There were also many light planes that kept flying in circles around all the main beaches with banners. One banner was a promotion for the upcoming movie 'Wicked,' another had the colours of the Trans flag and seemed to be advocating for trans rights. Given how many people were on the beach, there were surprisingly few people actually swimming. And those that were swimming didn't tend to go very far out. I had a quick dip, but I was wary of my possessions lying unattended on the sand. The water was warm and refreshing. Of course, the beaches are not really about the sand or the water. They're about the people. They are a place for family's and friends to come together, to party, or just to relax.

    I finished an evening with a meal and a margarita at the renowned Boteco Belmonte. There were cheaper options available but I decided to splash out with a seafood dish, as I hadn’t had any seafood yet. The dish was Octopus served with cassava and paprika oil, and I washed it down with a classic margarita. Not a bad way to spend an evening.

    On the way back, I noticed they had closed off the main road next to the beach. There were many people gathered there in colourful clothes. Without realising it, I had stumbled into an LGBT parade, a mini Carnaval. No idea if this is a regular occurrence in Copacabana. They blasted music from these trucks, and the sound mixed together into this incoherent excruciatingly loud mess. But the people seemed to enjoy it. There was a lot of dancing and drinking and smoking and people falling over, and a lot of exposed skin.

I also asked a drag queen and her friend to pose for me, and got a pretty good picture. The girl on the right was selling penis-shaped lollipops.

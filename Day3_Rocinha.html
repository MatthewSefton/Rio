    I was a little reluctant about going on one of the favela tours and wasn’t quite sure what to expect. Would it be very touristy? Would it be dangerous?
    Would the tour actually benefit the people living there? In the end I decided to book a tour at the last minute. We met our guide in a van in Copacabana.
    There were about 12 of us, from different countries: Germany, France, Mexico, Australia. This particular tour was in English, but our guide, Edwin, spoke several languages.
    Before I write about Rocinha I will tell you about Edwin.
  </p> 

    <p> 
        Edwin, 37, was born and raised in Rocinha. One day, as a young man, he was asked to tag along with the tour guides going through the favela, and in this way, 
        gradually learnt to speak English. Eventually, he was able to run the tours himself. On one of these tours he met his future wife, an Israeli woman. 
        They fell in love and, in what must have been a very bold move on her part, she decided to come and live with him in the favela. The two married and had a child. 
        Hoping to provide their son with a better quality of life, they decided to move to Israel, but due to some complications with work and the recent conflicts with Palestine, 
        they were forced to move back to Brazil, and as they could not afford to live somewhere in the city proper (Rio is an expensive place) they moved back once more to Rocinha. 
        Edwin is still worried about his kids life and his education. He even told me he was hoping to one day move to Australia, though he knew immigration would be tough.

<p>
    Now, Rocinha is nestled between the mountains in the South Zone, near Leblon. Because of the rich surrounding neighbourhoods, it gets more government funding and infrastructure 
    than many of the other favelas, and is generally considered safe for tourists, provided of course that they have an experienced local guide. We started the tour about midway 
    up the mountain. The salient image, aside from the colourful building, are the thousands upon thousands of cables running everywhere between the houses. Most of the people 
    here do not pay for their amenities. The water and electricity are essentially stolen, but the government and the police turn a blind eye, as they do for much of what 
    happens in the favelas. Some of the wires hang so low that you could easily bump into them, but our guide tells us not to worry about it, and that electrocution 
    is actually included as part of the package in our tour.
</p>

<p>
    The second thing that was surprising about Rocinha was how much business was going on. The favelas are not simply spaces for residence, they are cities. Some 200,000 
    people live in Rocinha and as such, you can find just about anything you would expect to find in small city: barbers, bakers, gambling houses, bars, clothe stores: all crammed 
    into tiny buildings. This is particularly the case down the bottom of the favela, which is generally the wealthier area because it is closer to the city. The area up the top, while home to much better views, is 
    actually very poor. Down the bottom, there are actually chain stores and you would barely even discern that the place was a favela if it wasn't for the wires hanging everywhere. 
</p>

<p> 
    We started our tour about midway up the mountain, on one of the main roads. While the place in general is dirty by most western standards (there are rats, there are dogs and 
    cats everywhere, there is trash and sewerage) it's still pretty clean as far as slums go. The main form of transportation is by motorcycle. Most of these are actually taxis
     and you can tell which motorcyclists are taxi drivers because they are wearing bright safety vests. 
</p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px;">

</div>

  
<p>As you get off the main roads you move into the unfamiliar: a winding labyrinth of alleyways and uneven stairs. You'll pass through a dark passage, wide enough for two 
    people to squeeze through, to suddenly find a nail salon in a little hole in the wall. Stone staircases lead down to fluorescent lights, where a man is watching the television. 
    A woman waves at us from a third storey window. Children run past, screaming profanities. There is little to no privacy here. You can often see inside people's houses.
     I asked Edwin if he got on well with his neighbours and he replied 'We have to.' The guide then takes us through someone's home. He obviously has a deal with the owner, 
     and we are allowed to go up onto their roof in exchange for 5 BRL. We climb three storeys and are rewarded with a good photo opportunity of the surrounding neighbourhood
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px;">

</div>

<p> Edwin is well known here, and as we make our way around the shops and residence people shout out 'Oi Gringo!" and come over and slap him on the back. The term gringo is usually 
    used to refer to a foreigner, though in this case it was probably used to refer to the fact that Edwin spoke English, dealt with tourists and spent time overseas. I didn't get the
    sense that it was pejorative. 
  </p>

<p>We pass an open sewerage system. It stinks, and there are rats, but it could be worse. At least there is running water. The entire favela isn't exactly what you would call 
    wheelchair accessible, and this is no joke-- it’s a real problem for anyone who is elderly here. Walking through the city is a workout and the people all have massive calves, 
    like soccer players.

  <p>
    After we get to the bottom we pause and our guide tells us that for this next part we should not have our cameras out. He also says that if we see people with guns we 
    shouldn't worry as they are just the mafia. As far as statements go this is not terribly reassuring, but Edwin is a nice guy and he jokes a lot so it's hard to actually
     tell if he was being serious. 
  </p>

  <p>
    He was. We walk down another dark alley, and come to a mural depicting Jesus. There, sure enough, are six or seven guys holding automatic rifles. These were soldiers of 
    Comando Vermelho (Red Commmand) the mafia syndicate that control Rocinha, as well as most of the favelas of the entire state of Rio de Janeiro . Edwin greets them; 
    he obviously has a relationship with these guys as well, and one of the guys with a submachine gun points to me and asks me where I'm from. Edwin tells him I'm from 
    Australia and the guy smiles and bumps fists with me and we continue on our way. The mafia functions like a business and these men were grunts, probably on the equivalent 
    of minimum wage, as Edwin explains to us. 
  </p>

  <p>
    According to Edwin, the main reason why the favela is safe for tourists is because of the influence of the Mafia. During the Rio Olympics the government tried to crack 
    down on crime syndicates and at one stage, Rocinha was under complete control of the police. But far from solving crime in the area, this arrangement actually lead to a 
    higher rate of public fights, stabbings and theft. The mafia control the people through fear. And while the citizens of Rocinha do not have legal ownership of their property 
    (at least from perspective of the Brazilian government) they pay taxes to the mafia. While violent crime and theft are low, there are plenty of drugs. The smell of marijuana 
    is pervasive, and we walked past a guy that had little plastics bag of what appeared to be cocaine. But who knows, maybe it was flour. Though Edwin claimed there was not much 
    crime here (apart from the drugs) he still told us that it was unsafe to come here if you did not know people from here. He would never set foot in another favela by himself, 
    for instance. The times when he has been to other favelas, he has always had guides or friends to pick him up and take him places. 
  </p>

  <p>
    But the favela has its hidden beauties. There is a famous artist here who is responsible for painting many murals around the place. You can see an example of his work 
    in the picture of Edwin above. There is even an overpriced artist studio where you can go and purchase prints of his works. I was tempted to get one but they were 250BRL 
    for a tiny sized print, and I had no idea if the studio was even connected to the original artist. Gentrification here is crazy. Imagine if a slum was owned by Disney. 
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px;">
    <img src="IMG_D3_7.jpg" alt="statue" style="width:600px; height:auto;">
  </div>

<p>
    But there are signs of hope and progress. Some kids are playing soccer in a recently built recreational space, outside a church. A little boy comes up to our group and 
    starts speaking French to the French girl. Another one  asks me questions about Australia. They are practicing their language skills, so that they may one day get a job, 
    either as a tour guide, like Edwin, or some other job in the city. Only about 5% of people in Rio speak English, Edwin tells us, and that makes learning the language pretty 
    attractive to businesses. 
</p>

  <p>
    Outside the church is a depiction of Christ’s Last Supper, favela style, complete with afro Jesus, soccer ball and pizza. I thought it was a remarkable, and far more 
    lively than Da Vincis dreary interpretation, though it was perhaps a little ironic that there were bullet holes in the walls of building opposite it. 
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    On the Van trip on the way back. Edwin told us that he is doing alright now, and that for the first time in his life he is actually able to afford health care, which was a 
    big deal for him considering his father died of painful and very expensive bone cancer. I don't even have health care, the lucky bastard. The whole trip was about $60 Aud, 
    but that money would partly go to the driver and the backup tour guide (who was still learning English) as well as the tour company itself. However much Edwin got, it was 
    clearly not enough to afford an apartment outside of a favela. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn’t sure what to think of the tour prior to going on it and I’m not sure I arrived at any easy conclusions. Rocinha is a place of contradictions. A touristy mafia city, 
    a gentrified slum. Tourists flock there to experience the novelty of poverty, but of course without any of the genuine hardships. Are they making a difference? Mostly no, but to some, 
    like the kids, or to Edwin, the tours may be of benefit. Would some of that money go to the mafia? Probably. At the end of the day, while poverty tourism might not actually help to the solve the problem,
    neither does sitting on a beach drinking caipirinhas.

    It was forecast to be a rainy day, but I was kind of okay with that because I was tired from the last few days. It was clear in the morning however so I decided to go for a stroll 
    up the East side of Praia de Copacabana, where I had not been. I was hoping I could get around the head of Ponta de Leme and explore the coastline there up to sugarloaf mountain.
    But not possible: there was a little trail that was promising, but after following it for a minute, it ended in rocks. Near this point, there was also statue of a little known Brazilian writer called Clarice Lispector, and her dog.

    Back near the beach, there was a man selling fruit on the side of the road and I bought a single banana with some change I had. The bananas here are very good. 
    They are smaller than the ones we get in Australia, but they are firm and a little sour. 

    I walked back through the city. On the way, I was stopped off at an intersection waiting to cross the road when I made eye contact with a shifty looking guy who was 
    sleeping on the streets. He was staring at me. I looked down at my phone to check where I was going, and when I looked up I saw that the light had gone green, so I began to cross the road. But suddenly I felt a pain shoot into me. I was bleeding. I had been so distracted that I had failed to recognise that there was a cement bollard right in front of me. My shin collided with it, and I stumbled and barely managed to stay upright. When I got up I made eye contact with the shifty looking man again, to check if he had witnessed all of this. He looked back at me in shock for a moment, then the broadest grin crept onto his face and he started laughing out loud. I slapped my palm to my face and shook my head in embarrassment. When I crossed the road, the owner of a café came out. He pointed at another bollard and laughed and said something in Portuguese, and while I don't speak a lick of the language I didn't need anyone to translate it for me. 
    I’m not cool enough for Rio.

    It was starting to rain so I went back to the hotel and had a shower, then went to a nearby carioca for lunch. I had a filet mignon sandwhich with cheese, 
    which was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. It was all pretty standard stuff, but the quality of the bread, meat and cheese just made it phenomenal-- and it 
    probably only cost me about $12 Aud. I also had another one of the local craft beers, Hocus Pocus. There is apparently a Hocus Pocus brewery somewhere nearby but I'm not sure if I will be able to get to it.

        I lounged around in my hotel for the rest of the day until I night fell, after which time I decided to go check out the nightlife of Copacabana. The place is a little seedy, 
        especially at night, so I was a little worried. But I stuck to the main streets and travelled light and I arrived at my destination: Beco das Garrafas. It was here on 
        "Bottle Alley" where Bossa Nova found its roots. This little club has live music every night, mostly jazz and bossa nova style. I had a couple of cocktails and sat and 
        listened to the band: which was a four piece playing some light lounge music. This style of music is very understated, and if you are not actively listening you can easily 
        zone out. It's elevator music, but if you actually pay attention to it-- as the locals clearly were-- it's not just background noise. There's just a soft, low energy to it.

        Some locals came up to me and tried to talk to me, but again, very few of them spoke English. One thing I have noticed here is that if you tell a Brazilian you don't speak Portuguese 
        (não fala português), they will often continue speaking to you in Portuguese, and you only have the choice but to smile and nod and say 'Sorry.' It's like they want to
         talk to you so bad that they'll try to anyway, even if you can't understand it. Well, it's a shame I didn't learn more of the language before I went on the trip. Still, 
         the music and drinks were nice.

    I had check out of the hotel in the morning, but my plane wasn’t until midnight. Initially I had planned to go Parque Large, but after cycling halfway there I realised this wasn’t going to happen. It was 34 degrees and humid. I have  no idea how the locals can stand the summer. 
</p> 

<p>
    So I spent the morning sitting down in a boteco and strolling around the shops. I bought some nice clothes from a place called Draco, just shorts and a singlet but the fabric was light and breathable, and the place was run by gay guys so you know it’s good. 
</p> 

<p>
    Visited the main shopping centre in Leblon: but it was just the same overpriced crap you find in any shopping centre. 
The food court at the top did have a beautiful panorama of the lagoon/ Christ the redeemer, but by now I has also had my fair share of of scenic vistas. 
</p> 

<p>
    I was starting to feel like I had overstayed my welcome in Rio. 
</p> 

<p>
    I went to the airport early, mostly to escape the  heat, and because my legs were killing me. Check in hadn’t opened yet so I sat on a bench, pulled out my Switch and started playing Stardew Valley: a game about a man living in a city who decides to quit his job and live a quiet, idyllic life out in the country. I was sitting there, absorbed in my little escapist fantasy, when after about an hour a man came up to me and asked me if I wanted to have my shoes cleaned. ‘Nao obrigado’ I told him. I was feeling a little insecure as I had all my luggage and my passport with me, as well as my Switch. I was also alone. It was just me and this guy in a fairly isolated part of the airport. Despite telling him I didn’t need his services, the guy leant down next to me and began scrubbing at my shoes. ‘No, I said again. ‘Thank you I’m good.’ The guy kept scrubbing. He had a little kit with him with polish and some brushes. ‘I’m fine.’ I said again, ‘no money. I don’t have any money.’ He kept scrubbing.  I wrestled my foot away. The man looked up at me and I saw that he was not really a man at all but a kid, maybe no older than 16. He was well dressed in neat clothes and he was wearing round glasses like Harry Potter. He looked back at me, silent for a moment. ‘I have to work,’ he said, calmly and in English. I nodded, slightly taken aback. After a moment I asked ‘where are you from?’  The boy told me his name and said he was from a nearby favela in Maré. I told him that his English was good, and he said he learnt from talking to tourists and reading signs and pamphlets.
</p> 

<p>
    At that moment I recalled my first journal entry  where I arrived in Rio and caught a cab out of the airport. I described a “poor post-apocalyptic wasteland” where the “ favelas tumble down from the mountains and sprawl out across the industrial, decaying cityscape.” Well, this kid was probably from around that area. Of course there was always a chance that he was a con artist, playing the sympathy card in order to solicit money from tourists. Hell, maybe he was the CEO of a Fortune 500 company and he simply liked going to airports and shining people’s shoes for fun. 
    I sighed and pulled out the neck-pocket thing where I kept my passport. I had some cash leftover: 50 BRL or about 15 Australian dollars. ‘Here,’ I said. ‘I was going to take this home, but it was just going to sit somewhere. I may as well give it to you.’ The boy thanked me,  and then offered to continue cleaning my shoes. ‘No,’ I said, ‘don’t worry about it. They’re shit shoes anyway.’ The boy then sat there in awkward silence. He didn’t quite know what to do. It seemed as if he still owed me something. ‘I… follow you?’ He said ‘translate for the airport?’
</p> 

<p>
    ‘Oh. No.’ I said, ‘no that’s fine. I can get by. Why don’t you just go and have a good afternoon. Buy yourself a beer or something.’ He nodded, sat in silence for a second, then thanked me again said goodbye and left. 
</p> 

<p>
    Afterwards I sat in thought. I felt ashamed that I had initially reacted to him with fear and rejection. Prior to coming to Rio I had been told again and  again that it was a dangerous city and that I should always be on my toes. But after all that, I never saw once saw any crimes, and never felt in any real danger. Looking up the statistics,  it seems as if Rio has a lower murder rate than many US cities, including Cleveland, if that means anything to you. 
</p> 

<p>
    I should have spent more time talking to the kid, but I was tired from the trip. Tired and sore.  They were announcing that check in was opening, so I gathered my luggage and took my place at the end of the queue.

    After the hustle and bustle of the favela I felt like a quiet day, but it was still sunny outside so I decided to make the most of the weather and  visit the Jardim Botanico. 
    Now, I made the mistake of thinking it was a good idea to walk there, once again underestimating the size of Rio. It was quiet on the streets when I left the hotel, at about 7:30, and pretty much every shop on the main road was closed.  I get the sense that Cariocas (people from Rio) are not early rises. 
    I walked along some of the main drags of Copacabana until I got to the great lagoon: Lagoa Rodriga de Freitas.

        Here it was a lot busier, as many men and women had come out for their morning jog around the water. The people here are big on exercise: they jog along the beach, 
        they ride bikes, they do their calisthenics at  many of the public workout bars. And all the hard work pays off. I’m talking body ody ody! There are more six packs here 
        than at an American frat party. Clearly it’s important to look beautiful, and besides, you need some way of burning off all that meat, cheese and pastries. 
        I decided to get in the spirit and try for a bit of a jog myself, but after going for about 10 minutes I was dripping with sweat. Curse this humidity.

        After another hour or so of walking I finally got to the botanical gardens. It was a large garden and there were very few people inside. In general I am learning that Rio is not a morning city. While I have been to some botanical 
        gardens that are more organised, I thought this one was very relaxing. On many occasions I found myself just sitting down on one of the benches and observing in silence.  
        One section  was dedicated to Amazonian plants and was very shady and green. It had a much more natural feel than most botanical gardens. Part of the garden bordered along the Tijuca forest, and here you could see monkeys in the tree 
        tops, feasting on jackfruit. There was a cactus garden and a herb garden, and some colourful finches and lizards.

        On the way home, I stopped off at a boteco and had a beef stroganoff with chips, something that apparently the Brazilian bars have in common with Australian pubs. 
        We also both love a chicken parma! I also discovered my love for the caipirissima, which is basically a caipirinha but with rum, but which was sweet and refreshing and 
        perfect after a long day in the sun.
